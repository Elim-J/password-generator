This is my third react project. I am learning how to save state and update state by using an array deconstructor. I also learned how to pass props to different componenets and how to determine styles in js using some boolean expressions. 


(But honestly though, I really wanted to make this project because I have been wanting to make a project that has a darkmode feature.)
